## About The Project

The project is entitled "Appointment Salon App" and consists of creating a mobile application to facilitate appointments at a beauty salon.

To access the application, a user must create an account in order to log in. The user has the opportunity to choose a service from among those available: make-up, hairstyle and manicure / pedicure at a salon from an available list, but also the time interval according to the availability of the salon for the selected day.

The user can also view the list of all appointments, as well as the updated status in real time. After completing an appointment, the customer can leave a review for the salon and the service.

The project is not related to a previously developed application, being at its initial version.

The field to which the developed product belongs is that of beauty, addressing both women and men, and the complexity of the project is average, cf. [System Complexity Space - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/system-complexity-space) .
